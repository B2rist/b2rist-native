    description:
      'Elephants are the heaviest land mammals in the world. The male African elephant can reach a weight of up to 6 tonnes. The Asian elephant, smaller than it’s African relative, has been domesticated for thousands of years, often being used as pack-animals. Katka and Wiki live in Oliwa Zoo and are rather elderly representatives of both species. They live together in the pavilion, which was prepared for the elephants in the early 50s.  The African elephant Katka was born around 1970 and came to us from France. She presented her excellent memory by recognizing her Czech keeper after not seeing him for 16 years!  The Asian elephant Wiki was born in 1964 and came to Oliwa zoo under very tragic circumstances after animal rights protection organisation retrieved her from a closed circus. She found her new home here with us in Gdansk. After the traumatic experience of working in a circus, Wiki needed two years in order to trust people again',

      'Lives in southwest Africa and is the biggest predator of the continent. It can be found in various environments: forested, semi-desert and even mountainous areas at the altitude of 4000m. Unlike other wild cats, lions live in pride consisting of up to 30 individuals.

    description:
      "With the Golden Gate and the Highland Gate, the Green Gate spans the Long Market and Long Street, together comprising the Royal Route. The Green Gate was clearly inspired by the Antwerp City Hall.[1] It was built 1568-71 as the formal residence of Poland's monarchs.[2] It is a masterpiece by Regnier (or Reiner van Amsterdam), an Amsterdam architect,[3] and reflects Flemish architectural influence in Gdańsk. Hans Kramer from Dresden was responsible for the construction plans.  On 11–20 February 1646 the future Queen of Poland, Marie Louise Gonzaga, was entertained here. In the late 18th century the Nature Society was housed here, but soon moved to the Naturalists' House (Research Society House).  Today the Green Gate houses the National Museum in Gdańsk. Exhibitions, meetings, conferences and shows are held here. The Gdańsk office of former Polish President Lech Wałęsa is located in one of the rooms.",
